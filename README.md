# GraphQL FAQ

This project hopes to collect common questions and answers into peer reviewed
and easily digestable form.

## Phase 1:

Collect FAQ proposals into the [/proposals](/proposals) dir as minimal markdown files
collecting links to relevant discussion, issues, comments.

All contributions should be merged quickly.

## Phase 2:

Draft content by taking interesting or high-impact questions from [/proposals](/proposals)
and writing a first draft answer and moving into [/drafts](/drafts). This can be derived by copy-pasting from
existing discussion or synthesizing into a new form.

Some review may happen to these PRs, but they should be merged promptly.

## Phase 3:

Review and edit drafts by technical writers or native speakers and move to [/published](/published).

Peer review should be done before merging, though edits and improvements are welcome.

## Phase 4 (can be done earlier):

Build Gatsby site which exposes published FAQs as google-crawlable pages along with
a top level page showing all/featured FAQ and a search bar. Use algolia or similar
to search across all FAQ.
